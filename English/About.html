<p><strong>ASRKARI</strong>
  <br>
  <em>A-srkāri</em> and <em>Asr-kāri</em> – the name can be pronounced in two different ways. Each way is a combination of two words with different meanings. The word <em>A-srkari</em> means non-governmental, i.e. community driven, and <em>Asr-kari</em> means effective.</p>
<p><strong>SATYAGRAHA</strong>
  <br>
  <em>Satyagraha</em> is a composition of two words from Sanskrit, <em>satya</em> (truth) and <em>āgraha</em> (insistence), and translates to “holding onto truth”. It is a particular form of non-violent resistance or civil resistance which advocates resisting non-violently over using violence. Resisting non-violently is considered the summit of bravery. The term was coined and developed by Mahatma Gandhi. He deployed satyagraha in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa for Indian rights<em>.</em>
